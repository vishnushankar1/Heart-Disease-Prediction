# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning. It uses a dataset containing 13 attributes to train a model and serve predictions via a Flask API.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following attributes:

1. Age
2. Sex
3. Chest pain type (4 values)
4. Resting blood pressure
5. Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
8. Maximum heart rate achieved
9. Exercise induced angina
10. Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. Thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vishnushankar/heart_disease_prediction.git
